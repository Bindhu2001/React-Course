# React Hooks Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple **small React projects** created to practice and master **all major React hooks** in real-world scenarios.  
Each project focuses on naturally using hooks in situations where they provide the most value.

## ðŸ“š Hooks Practiced
- **useState** â€“ Manage local state in components
- **useEffect** â€“ Handle side effects like data fetching & timers
- **useRef** â€“ Access DOM elements or persist mutable values
- **useContext** â€“ Share state globally without prop drilling
- **useCallback** â€“ Prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions
- **useId** â€“ Generate unique IDs for accessibility and forms
